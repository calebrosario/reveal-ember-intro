##  What are data adapters

```

App.TodoAdapter = DS.RESTAdapter.extend(); 
//App.TodoAdapter = DS.FixtureAdapter.extend();
```

An adapter is an object that knows about your particular server backend and is responsible for translating requests for and changes to records into the appropriate calls to your server.
