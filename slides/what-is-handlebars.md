##  What is Handlebars

NOTE:
 templating library to power your app's user interface. Handlebars templates are just like regular HTML, but also give you the ability to embed expressions that change what is displayed.

We take Handlebars and extend it with many powerful features. It may help to think of your Handlebars templates as an HTML-like DSL for describing the user interface of your app. And, once you've told Ember.js to render a given template on the screen, you don't need to write any additional code to make sure it keeps up-to-date.
